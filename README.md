#Ruby On The Web

This is a lesson on the [http protocol](http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#whatis) and using [Ruby's sockets](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/ruby/ruby_socket_programming.htm) from Ruby's standard library to create a simple server and client to send and receive http based messages through sockets and mimic http requests.

This is a project for [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/ruby-on-the-web) for more information.
